cloaked-octo-emulator
=====================

A gameboy emulator written in C++/Qt/OpenGL for the fun of it. I'm using this project to develop better programming skills and learn some in depth cpu architecture stuff


### Tests
In order to test the emulator, you'll need test roms. You can find them here from [blargg](http://slack.net/~ant/old/gb-tests/)
So go into the "testRoms" folder and issue:

> wget -r -nd http://slack.net/~ant/old/gb-tests/

and then unzip the tests you want to run

> unzip '*.zip'


(TODO) how to run tests
